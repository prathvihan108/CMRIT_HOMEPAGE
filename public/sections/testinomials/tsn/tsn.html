							The CMR Jnanadhara Trust was established in 1991 to deliver the
							highest quality of education to one and all. With this view, the
							CMR educational institutes were founded, to give every student a
							chance at an outstanding, value-based and well-rounded education.
							We began with only a handful of kindergarten students when the CMR
							National Public School first opened its doors nearly two decades
							ago, but due to the dedicated services of the Trust, to the
							community, we have grown tremendously since then. Today, CMR Group
							of Institutions consists of 19 institutions in India and abroad,
							69 different academic programmes, and over 900 faculty members.
							Every year, more than 15000 students including international
							students from over 58 countries study in our classrooms. I am
							proud to say that our students and alumni are enthusiastic,
							dedicated learners and high achievers. Each CMR campus is equipped
							with the best of infrastructure: well-stocked libraries, wireless
							internet everywhere, state of the art laboratories, comfortable,
							secure hostel accommodation, several world class auditoriums and
							sports facilities.
