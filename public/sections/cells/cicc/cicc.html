					<h2>Purpose of CICC</h2>
					<p>
						CMRIT believes that the principles of justice, humanity and dignity
						should be dispensed irrespective of caste, creed, social status and
						gender of a person. Therefore in keeping with the ethos of this
						institution and in acquiescence with the instructions of National
						Commission for Women and the directives of Hon’ble Supreme Court
						Judgment (Attachment 1) on the subject of sexual harassment of women
						in the workplace, an Internal Complaints Committee was established
						for taking into account the complaints of sexual harassment of women
						staff and students.
					</p>
					<h2>Procedure for filing a Complaint</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Complaints regarding sexual harassment must be mailed to the
							chairperson or submitted in written (legible handwriting) form on
							paper.
						</li>
						<li>
							The nature of the complaint should be clearly stated in detail,
							including dates and locations of the incidents.
						</li>
						<li>
							As per The Act, complaints must be made within three months from
							the date of the incident, or from the date of the last incident in
							case of a series.
						</li>
						<li>
							The complaint must not be anonymous, and the aggrieved person’s
							name and address should be legible.
						</li>
						<li>
							According to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace
							(Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Rules, 2013, if the
							aggrieved woman is unable to file a complaint due to physical
							incapacity, a co-worker or any person with knowledge of the
							incident can file on her behalf with her written consent.
						</li>
						<li>
							The written complaint should be handed over to any member of the
							CICC.
						</li>
