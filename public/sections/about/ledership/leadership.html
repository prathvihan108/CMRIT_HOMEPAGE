						The CMR Jnanadhara Trust was established in 1991 to deliver the
						highest quality of education to one and all. With this view, the CMR
						educational institutes were founded, to give every student a chance
						at an outstanding, value-based and well-rounded education. We began
						with only a handful of kindergarten students when the CMR National
						Public School first opened its doors nearly two decades ago, but due
						to the dedicated services of the Trust, to the community, we have
						grown tremendously since then. Today, CMR Group of Institutions
						consists of 19 institutions in India and abroad, 69 different
						academic programmes, and over 900 faculty members. Every year, more
						than 15000 students including international students from over 58
						countries study in our classrooms. I am proud to say that our
						students and alumni are enthusiastic, dedicated learners and high
						achievers. Each CMR campus is equipped with the best of
						infrastructure: well-stocked libraries, wireless internet
						everywhere, state of the art laboratories, comfortable, secure
						hostel accommodation, several world class auditoriums and sports
						facilities.

						Learning is ‘fun’ at CMRIT, as students and faculty members get
						together to make a difference through persevering and achieving
						intellectual satisfaction. We emphasise the motto “Learning to
						Learn”, during the students’ sojourn here, when ‘learning’ becomes a
						lifelong practice. Several prestigious international and national
						awards garnered by students and faculty epitomizes CMRIT as an
						eminent engineering institute. The unique ‘Maker Space’ on campus,
						the first of its kind in Bengaluru, imbibes design thinking, where
						students experiment with ideas and build prototypes. Over the years,
						students have worked and created several useful products and
						solutions addressing the pain-points of society. CMRIT has several
						jewels in its crown: an award by the President of India for an
						innovative and frugal technique to diagnose infectious diseases; an
						international medal for outstanding contributions to advance
						material science and technology; fellow titles from Stanford
						University; training for students at Google Mountain View, USA; an
						award at Microsoft Vfest; an award at Texas Instruments Challenge;
						awards by IEEE; a Portuguese innovation medal; a gold medal at the
						India International Innovation Fair; as well as several top ranks in
						the university amongst other achievements.

						CMR Institute of Technology (CMRIT), established in the year 2000
						with a vision to be a globally recognized institution to provide
						high-quality technical and management education, believes that
						students are the torchbearers of every nation. In order to bring in
						positive change towards a sustainable future, we ensure all round
						development of students by inculcating active participation in
						various technical and non-technical clubs that provide ample
						opportunities for gaining practical knowledge and industry skills;
						in tandem with the conventional academic curriculum. We encourage
						hands-on learning through major/ mini interdisciplinary projects
						with support of our state-of-the-art Makerspace laboratory that
						houses CNC machines, laser cutter, 3D printing tools, Centres of
						Excellence and research labs. Many of our alumni are at top
						positions globally and are actively involved in imparting project
						experiences to students. Our non-technical clubs include the likes
						of sports, music, dance, and the Kannada club. These activities
						provide students various pathways to widen their horizons beyond
						academics enabling them to create a niche in today’s fast-changing
						and competitive world. CMRIT is also determined to serve the rural
						community by adopting villages to provide technical solutions to
						their real-time problems. Our students and faculty are also actively
						involved in this mission. To encourage leadership and team spirit
						amongst students, we conduct a number of national and international
						conferences, seminars and workshops.
