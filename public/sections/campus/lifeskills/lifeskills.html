							timely “Hand UP”!</b

					</p>
					<p>
						CMR Life Skills Institute (CMRLSI), is the training arm of the CMR
						Group of Institutions (CMRGI), a conglomerate comprising of over 20
						schools and colleges, 20,000 students and over 2500 teaching and
						non-teaching staff. CMRLSI offers life skills training to students,
						teaching, non-teaching staff and others who are actively involved in
						contributing to the growth and success of the institutions in the
						group.s.
					</p>
					<p>
						The institute has a thought provoking tag line “Transcending
						Boundaries of Formal Education”©, which clearly underscores the fact
						that every individual irrespective of their role in society needs
						certain essential skills beyond their domain knowledge, in order to
						be successful in whichever walk of life they choose to excel in.
					</p>
					<p>
						CMRLSI endeavors to satisfy this need through training, behavioral
						coachingand mentoring. The objective is to touch as many lives as
						possible, providing enduring values in the process and transform the
						future generations of the society to become better citizens of this
						world

					<h2>Training-</h2>
					<h3>Training For Students</h3>
					<p>
						Curriculum for students includes communication skills, personality
						development, aptitude and finishing school skills training, which is
						interlaced in their regular course work. This helps in improving
						their employability quotient to a great extent, as companies who
						come to campuses to employ students look for these attributes in new
						recruits, more than their prowess in their domain skills. Hence the
						students’ transition from the campus to the corporate / business
						world becomes very smooth and seamless.
					</p>
					<h3>Training For the teaching staff</h3>
					<p>
						Use of innovative techniques as alternatives to ‘chalk &amp; talk’,
						effective use of technology to attain success in teaching ‘Gen-Y’,
						use of path-breaking methods like flipped classrooms are some of the
						areas that are focussed upon. This helps the faculty in surpassing
						the expectations of the students in their learning process, and
						achieves the desired objective of creating thinkers rather than
						learners by rote.
					</p>
					<h3>Training For non-teaching staff</h3>
					<p>
						Administrative, non-teaching and other staffs who contribute to the
						growth of the institutions in the group are provided training
						periodically in order that they reach their highest potential in
						their respective areas of work. The objective is to ensure that they
						understand the importance of their roles and take pride in
						performing their duties and derive satisfaction for having
						contributed to the overall success of the group.
