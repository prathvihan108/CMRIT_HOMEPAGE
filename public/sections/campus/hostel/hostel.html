					<h2>Student Accommodation</h2>
					<p>
						Accommodation is one of the critical components of an educational
						institution in Bangalore. A good student housing allows the student
						to take their minds off day-to-day living issues like power, food,
						commuting to college, laundry, and security. We ensure that students
						dwell in a healthy environment that helps them to grow and learn
						without any obstacle. Parents are at peace knowing that their child
						is well cared for and secure in a nurturing and homely environment.
