					<h2>The Council-</h2>
					<p>
						Formed over 10 years ago, they are the student representatives
						responsible for regulating the clubs and organizing a number of
						events spanning the entire academic year. They help uplift the
						college academically and otherwise by conducting major intra and
						intercollegiate cultural, sports and technical fests hence ensuring
						an all round development of students in college, at large. “We
						strive to walk the extra mile and create a difference” is what they
						aim and work for!
					</p>

					<h2>Extra-Curricular Activities -</h2>
					<h3>
						At CMR, our vision is to nurture creative thinkers who will drive
						positive global change. The Physical Education Department fosters
						this vision by training students and assisting them in maintaining
						their fitness through various sports activities.
					</h3>
					<p>
						The objective is to build competitive teams in various sporting
						events like Cricket, Football, Hockey, BasketBall, Throw Ball,
						Shuttle Badminton, Lawn Tennis, Table Tennis, Swimming, Athletics,
						Gymnastics and others.
					</p>
					<p>
						To encourage sports, the talented sports persons are provided with a
						host of facilities such as:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Accommodation in hostels.</li>
						<li>
							Extra Coaching for completion of syllabus for sports persons.
						</li>
						<li>Travel allowance, reimbursement, and other support.</li>
						<li>Financial and academic support.</li>
						<li>
							Participating students are provided exemptions from classes and
							assessments as per the UGC sports norms.
						</li>
						<li>
							These students are treated as ‘on duty’ and are provided
							attendance on the specified number of days as certified by the
							concerned Dean in case of shortage of attendance beyond 25%.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						For students participating in various sports activities and thereby
						missing their internal assessment tests, the concerned faculty
						arranges separate tests/assessments covering the same syllabus. This
						is a part of the duty of the concerned Dean of the School who
						facilitates the tests/assessments
					</p>
					<p>
						The sports students, exempted from attendance, are separately
						certified by the concerned HODs/Deans in case of shortage of
						attendance. Special lectures are scheduled, for these students on
						the topics missed, with prior permission from the respective Deans.
					</p>
					<p>
						In case students attending sports activities miss internal
						assessment tests or assignments, the concerned faculty makes the
						required arrangements with permissions of the respective HODs/Deans.
					</p>
					<p>
						The department of physical education, along with that of the
						concerned faculty coordinates with the HODs/Dean in all such cases,
						in advance.
