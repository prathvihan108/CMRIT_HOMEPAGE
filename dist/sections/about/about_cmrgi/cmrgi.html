					<h2>CMR Jnanadhara Trust</h2>
					<img src="/assets/images/about/founder.jpg" alt="founder cmr" />
					<p>
						The CMR Jnanadhara Trust was established in 1990, as a tribute to
						the late Sri Chikka Muniyappa Reddy, a visionary educationalist and
						philanthropist who believed that every individual deserves access to
						a quality education. In accordance with his vision, the CMR
						educational institutes were founded to give every student a chance
						at an outstanding, value-based and well-rounded education. The CMR
						Jnanadhara Trust supports and manages all the activities of the CMR
						Group of Institutions.

					<h2>CMR Logo</h2>
					<img src="/assets/images/about/cmrgi.jpg" alt="founder cmr" />
					<p>
						The CMR logo is rooted in Indian tradition, yet rendered in the
						contemporary form of the Hamsa, the Swan. The swan is the carrier of
						Goddess Saraswathi – the Goddess of Learning. It is said that the
						Swan with its sensitive beak has the power of discrimination – an
						ability to distinguish pure milk from a mixture of milk and water.
						The wings of the Swan rendered in the alternating flowing lines of
						blue and white represent the metaphor of milk and water. The blue
						stands for clarity of purpose and the white for purity of vision.
						The overall form of the logo radiates and sparkles in the calm,
						self-contained posture of the Swan gliding on water
