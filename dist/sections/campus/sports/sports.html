					<h2>Physical Education & Sports--</h2>
					<p>
						Physical Education & Sports- Physical education-is an integral part
						of educational programs designed to promote the optimum development
						of an individual physically, emotionally, mentally, socially and
						spiritually through total body movement in the performance of
						properly selected physical activities. The primary aims of physical
						education have varied, based on the needs of the time and place.
						Most of the institutions’ goal is to provide students with
						knowledge, skills, capacities, values and the enthusiasm to maintain
						a healthy lifestyle into adulthood. Activities included in the
						programme are designed to promote physical fitness, to develop motor
						skills, to instill knowledge and understanding of rules, concepts,
						and strategies. Students learn to either work as part of a team, or
						as individuals, in a wide variety of competitive activities.

						Sport is an activity that is governed by a set of rules or customs
						and often engaged in competitively. Sports is commonly referred to
						activities where the physical capabilities of the competitor are the
						sole or primary determinant of the outcome (winning or losing), but
						the term is also used to include activities such as mind sports (a
						common name for some card games and board games. Sport is commonly
						defined as an organized, competitive and skillful physical activity
						requiring commitment and fair play.
