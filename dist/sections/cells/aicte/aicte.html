					<h2>ABOUT NISP</h2>
					<p>
						The Ministry of Education (MoE), Govt. of India has established
						MoE’s Innovation Cell (MIC) to systematically nurture the culture of
						Innovation among all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The
						‘National Innovation and Startup Policy (NISP) 2019 for students and
						faculty in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) was launched by
						former Minister of Education, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ on
						11th September 2019 at AICTE, New Delhi..
					</p>
					<p>
						The policy aims to assist higher education institutions in
						developing, streamlining, and strengthening their innovation and
						entrepreneurial ecosystems on campus. It will be critical in
						maximizing the potential of students’ creative problem-solving and
						entrepreneurial mindsets, as well as fostering strong intra and
						interinstitutional partnerships with ecosystem enablers and various
						stakeholders at the regional, national, and international levels.
					</p>
					<p>
						MIC has envisioned encouraging creation of the Institution’s
						Innovation Council (IICs) across HEIs. A network of IICs is formed
						to foster innovation and entrepreneurship in the institution through
						a variety of techniques, resulting in a campus-wide innovation
						ecosystem. MIC has established the Institution’s Innovation Council
						in more than 2500 Institutions till December 2021.
