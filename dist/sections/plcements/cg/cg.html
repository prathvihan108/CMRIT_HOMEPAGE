					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
						CMR Institute of Technology’s academic distinction is echoed in its
						students’ consummate record in placements in the corporate and
						engineering sectors. CMRIT has consistently maintained an admirable

						role in preparing students for their personal and professional life.
						Set up in 2000, the Career Guidance and Placement Bureau functions
						across all academic departments and offers placement assistance.

						We put forward a variety of student-centric services as a single
						window point for career counselling and career development in all
						fields which complement classroom learning and prepare students for
						careers in industry, entrepreneurship, research or further studies.

						aspirations and plans for one’s careers ahead. Whether one is
						interested in pursuing further studies, becoming entrepreneur or
						working in industry, we are here to help.

						Our goal is to help students apply their education and experiences
						towards advancing their career goals. Irrespective of the choice of
						career, be it continuing education, working for an organization, or
						entrepreneurship, we enable students to understand their strengths,
						goals, interests, and future career options so that they may take
						appropriate steps towards career preparation and personal growth.
