					<h2>Campus Hiring-</h2>
					<p>
						Each year, we invite our industry partners and other reputed
						organizations to the college campus to participate in the placement
						process for both Undergraduate and Postgraduate programmes. We
						connect to invited companies, discuss their requirements and
						mutually agree on a tentative date for doing the placement drive. We
						also connect to all students, collate the student data, get their
						registrations for placements and brief them the placement policy and
						rules before the placement season starts for all the final year
						students.
					</p>
					<p>
						We follow the below placement process for smooth running of
						placement drives and the post selection steps of offer acceptance,
						pre-joining formalities and the candidate joining process:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<strong>Company Requirements and Details:</strong> Companies
								share job requirements, position descriptions, eligibility
								criteria, salary details, and company introduction.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Publishing on Internal Portal:</strong> The company
								details and requirements are published on the college’s internal
								portal for students to view.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Student Registration:</strong> Eligible and interested
								students register for the job opportunities through the portal.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Data Sharing with Companies:</strong> A list of eligible
								students, including their details (degree/department, date of
								birth, prior education marks, current CGPA, backlogs, etc.), is
								shared with the company.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Shortlisting by Companies:</strong> Companies review the
								student data, shortlist candidates (if necessary), and send the
								final list of selected students prior to the placement drive
								date.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Pre-Placement Talk:</strong> On the placement drive
								date, companies conduct pre-placement talks, providing job
								overviews, compensation, expectations, and answering students’
								questions.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Selection Process:</strong> Companies typically conduct
								Written Tests, Group Discussions, Case Studies, and Personal
								Interviews.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Announcement of Selections:</strong> Most companies
								announce the selected students by the end of the day on the
								drive date, followed by a confirmation email from the company’s
								HR team.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Offer Letter Process:</strong> Companies send formal
								offer letters to individual students with a copy to the
								placement department.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Post-Offer Activities:</strong> The placement department
								connects with students and follows through the acceptance
								process and any other post-offer activities like document
								submissions, briefing sessions, training, internships, etc.

								remains connected with students and companies until all students
